Okay, we'll store three things
	X = MP2 amplitudes from current rS
	Y = MP2 amplitudes from previous rS
	T = CC amplitudes from previous rS, to be overwritten

I will write
	X = a Y + dX
where I choose a to minimize dX:
	dX^2 = (X - a*Y)^2 = X^2 - 2 a X.Y + a^2 Y^2
which means
	a = X.Y/Y.Y
and I will then assume
	T => a T + dX
which I can write as
	T => X + a (T-Y).
This will serve as a guess except at the first rS, where I'll choose MP2.
