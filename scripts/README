REAME for Connectivity Averaging FORTRAN code:--tmihm, Jan 22,2019
======================================
Electron gas coupled cluster doubles code, modified to have the input as automated, only performs connectivty averaging
Corrected weighting for calculations,Includes Runs for increasing basis set and Rs for set N

NOTE: current basis set input is not correct for electron number. Need to change before running calculations!!! 

NOTE: Memory is not automated to adjust for increased system size. That has to be done manually for each job script before submitting.
NOTE: File named 'time' contains run time for specific job. 

        ZRun*: contain code to run automated twist averaged calculation at rs* for connectivity averaging
                Currently set up to have 100 twist angles

              output for calculations generated in fort.59:

                "average" - average calcualtion for run
                "error" - error for average calculation
                Collum 1-3 : twist angles x, y, z
                Collum 4-6 : HF energy, MP2 energy, CCD energy
                bottom of fort.59 shows chosen "special twist angle" based on connectivity

              Output file:
                100 MP2 calculations
		last output is CCD calculations for special twist angle

        File is set up to automatically run over electrons: 14-3000

                file is automated to perform all electron number runs at once
                Files are labed: N - el - Cutoff
                templates file set up to model input for all files generated by setup.sh
                modifications to inputs for these calculations are done in input file in "templates" for parameters besides el and cutoff

                Order of run:
                  ./make (from "code")
                  cd ZRunBasis
                  ./setup.sh -- set up files to contain input code and job scripts for each basis set
                  ./batch.sh -- runs through files created by setup.sh and submits them to the Q
                  once jobs have finished
                  ./analyze.sh -- pulls all relavent data from output and prints to screen

	NOTE: Electron numbers >970 currently due not run to completion due to "denom factor" requiring changing
